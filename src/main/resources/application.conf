topology {

  # Specifies how many processes you want allocated around the cluster to execute the topology.
  # Each component in the topology will execute as many threads. The number of threads allocated to a given
  # component is configured through the setBolt and setSpout methods. Those threads exist within worker processes.
  # Each worker process contains within it some number of threads for some number of components.
  # For instance, you may have 300 threads specified across all your components and 50 worker processes specified
  # in your config. Each worker process will execute 6 threads, each of which of could belong to a different component.
  # You tune the performance of Storm topologies by tweaking the parallelism for each component and the number of
  # worker processes those threads should run within.
  #
  # Config path can be fetched using the constant org.apache.storm.Config.TOPOLOGY_WORKERS
  workers = 1

  # The maximum amount of time given to the topology to fully process a message
  # emitted by a spout. If the message is not acked within this time frame, Storm
  # will fail the message on the spout. Some spouts implementations will then replay
  # the message at a later time.

  # Config path can be fetched using the constant org.apache.storm.Config.TOPOLOGY_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_SECS
  message.timeout.secs = 30

  # When set to true, tells Storm to log every message every emitted by a component.
  # This is useful in local mode when testing topologies, but you probably want to keep this turned off
  # when running topologies on the cluster.

  # Config path can be fetched using the constant org.apache.storm.Config.TOPOLOGY_DEBUG
  debug = true

  # How many instances to create for a spout/bolt. A task runs on a thread with zero or more
  # other tasks for the same spout/bolt. The number of tasks for a spout/bolt is always
  # the same throughout the lifetime of a topology, but the number of executors (threads) for
  # a spout/bolt can change over time. This allows a topology to scale to more or less resources
  # without redeploying the topology or violating the constraints of Storm (such as a fields grouping
  # guaranteeing that the same value goes to the same task).

  # Config path can be fetched using the constant org.apache.storm.Config.TOPOLOGY_TASKS

  # The maximum parallelism allowed for a component in this topology. This configuration is
  # typically used in testing to limit the number of threads spawned in local mode.
