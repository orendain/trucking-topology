# trucking-topology

Note: This branch is here more as a reference and save point than anything.

This branch assumes that events are being sourced from two different spouts.  It defines a bolt to join the two streams of events before moving on.

At the time of this branching, the master branch has begun moving towards a more realistic, single-source stream of events.  Thus, this branch is considered outdated and may not be receiving updates.
